\subsection{Introduction to Projective Geometry}

\begin{definitionBox}{Projective Spaces}
Projective spaces are a generalisation of spaces such as $\mathbb{R}^n$ using linear algebra. \\
Let $\F$ be a field (usually, these fields are $\R$ or $\C$ but they can by also be any arbitrary field $\F_p$).
